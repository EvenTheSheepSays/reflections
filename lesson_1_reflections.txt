How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Very helpful

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It's good to have save states for a project

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It's less tiresome

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because they are all dependant on each other, otherwise the whole project wouldn't work after switching to older version (snapshot)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log to see all the commits and their ID's so later I could use them with diff to see the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can always roll back to previous versions with "git checkout" command to find a bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
