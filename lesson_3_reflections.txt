When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I use different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because the most up to date version can contain bugs. Because I want to keep up to date only on those projects that I'm currently working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are cloning inbetween GitHub accounts.
    Cloning is GitHub->local or local->local.
    Branches are alternate paths of the project itself.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Obviously to evade the future conflicts during the pulls. The more local and remote repos are similar the less tedious it will be to fix conflicts if they happen.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I have no idea how to live without them in general D:

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I need it to make sure everything will work later. So I can keep different branches with different changes and solve their conflicts separately so I could merge everything in the master branch in the end.
